My-House

Description
My house is a web system. I'm developing to practice my knowledge of React Js and Single Page Applications. 
The system allows people interested in renting or buying a property, to see available properties and their location through the map. The System has the contact of the owner so that the client can communicate with the owner and a registration form so that the client can communicate the owner of the property through the system.

In short, the system will allow:
•	See available properties;
•	View the property details through slides and will also have a description;
•	See the contact of the owner of the property;
•	See the address of the property through the map;
•	Fill in the registration form to contact the owner.

Technologies/tools used
•	React JS;
•	css;
•	HTML5;
•	Bootstrap.

How to use the system?
To use the system will be quite simple. Just have the link, access to the Internet, access and view all available properties, the location of the property, the owner's contact and the registration form, all on a single page.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
